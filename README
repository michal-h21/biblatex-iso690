Style ISO 690 for biblatex
==========================

Biblatex is bibliography and citation tool for LaTeX. This project provides
support for citations in ISO 690 style.  As the norm is a little bit ambiguous
in some details regarding formatting of records, we largely follow
requirements of Czech interpretation, as it is required form in many Czech
universities. Style can be used in other languages as well, of course.
