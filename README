Style ISO 690 for biblatex
==========================

Biblatex is bibliography and citation tool for LaTeX. 

Install
-------

Unzip contents of the file biblatex-iso690.zip to your local texmf dir. You can
find its location with the following command:

    kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME
    
If this directory doesn't exist, you can create it. Also, do not forget about latex 
directory structure. That means you need to create (if doesn't exist yet), for example, 
~/texmf/tex/latex/biblatex-iso690 if you use LaTeX. In case you are using XeTeX or 
LuaTeX you will need to replace /tex/latex by an appropriate path. Afterwards run:

    texhash 

This command rebuilds TeX files database. After this your system should be able 
recognize biblatex-iso690.


Usage:
------ 
...
\usepackage[english,czech]{babel} % main language of the document must be last
\usepackage[
   backend=biber      % if we want unicode 
  ,style=iso-authoryear % or iso-numeric for numeric citation method          
  ,babel=other        % to support multiple languages in bibliography
  ,sortlocale=cs_CZ   % locale of main language, it is for sorting
  ,bibencoding=UTF8   % this is necessary only if bibliography file is in different encoding than main document
]{biblatex}
... 

Custom options:
