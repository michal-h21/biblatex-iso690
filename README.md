# Biblatex style for ISO 690 standard

`biblatex` is a bibliography and citation tool for LaTeX. This project provides
support for citations in ISO 690 style. As the standard is a little bit
ambiguous in some details regarding formatting of records, we largely follow
requirements of Czech interpretation, as it is required form in many Czech
universities. The style can be used in other languages as well, of course.

## Installation

The package is included in MikTeX and TeX Live distributions since 2016, so it
could be shipped with your TeX installation.

It is also available on CTAN as `biblatex-iso690`:

https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-iso690

### Install from GitHub

Open the terminal and find location of your `TEXMFHOME` directory with this
command:

    kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME

Open this directory and check that the directory `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex`
exists. If it doesn't exist, you must create it. You can do this from the
command line or using a file manager. Open the `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex`
directory and either run the command

    git clone git@github.com:michal-h21/biblatex-iso690.git

or unzip the file

    https://github.com/michal-h21/biblatex-iso690/archive/master.zip

here. You should be able to use `biblatex-iso690` now.

## Usage

```latex
\usepackage[english,czech]{babel} % the main document language is the last one
\usepackage[
  backend=biber,        % if we want unicode and many other features (biber is already by default)
  style=iso-authoryear, % or another iso-<style>
]{biblatex}
```

### Citation and bibliography styles

`biblatex-iso690` provides the following styles (both for citations
and bibliographies). You can select one with `style` keyword in the
package options of `biblatex`.

* `iso-alphabetic`

  * **[false]** `context dependent`

### Bibliographic fields

Some fields have a different meaning than in plain BibTeX, as compared to
`biblatex`.

1\. If the publication is written in a different language to the main
document, it should have a filled `langid` field.

```
langid = {czech},
```

2\. Publications with online versions should have a `urldate` field. It is the
date when you last checked the publication online.

```
urldate = {2011-01-12},
```

3\. If the publication has more than one ISBN or ISSN number, preferably use
just one of them. Otherwise you can separate multiple numbers with comma in
the respective field.

4\. Publisher and place:

```
location = {Praha},
publisher = {Academia},
```

Some fields are added on top of the fields supported by `biblatex` and are
valid only for this package.

5\. Supervisor of thesis / dissertation:

```
supervisor = {Petr Sojka},
```

6\. Date specificities, anything that doesn't fit into the `date` field:

```
dateaddon = {\mkbibbrackets{16th century}},
```

For more details see the example bibliography file [biblatex-iso690-examples.bib](./biblatex-iso690-examples.bib).

### Translations

This package comes with the extension of the localization files (`.lbx`) to
their standard versions shipped with `biblatex`. The naming convention for
these files is `<langid>-iso.lbx`, where `langid` is the name of the language
known by Babel.

If the `<langid>.lbx` is already included in `biblatex`, adding a
`<langid>-iso.lbx` is as easy as adding this single file to the root directory
of this package. Otherwise, please consider [a contribution to the `biblatex`
package](https://github.com/plk/biblatex/#translation) first.

If you also aim to add new localization strings, you have to define them via
`\NewBibliographyString` command at the beginning of the [iso.bbx](iso.bbx)
file.

A quick translation guideline for the additional strings is available at the
wiki page [Translation
Guideline](https://github.com/michal-h21/biblatex-iso690/wiki/Translation-Guideline).

You might want to see also some already existing translations, e.g.
[english-iso.lbx](english-iso.lbx) or [slovak-iso.lbx](slovak-iso.lbx).
